# Retrieval of Legal Documents Text Excerpts
This project focuses on the retrieval of text excerpts from legal documents using prompts such as LLM, Pinecone, and advanced RAG.

## Overview
The project utilizes advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in conjunction with LLM (Legal Language Model) and Pinecone, a vector database service, to optimize index structures. This combination allows for efficient and precise retrieval of relevant information from a vast database of legal documents.

Key Features
Optimized Index Structures: The project uses Pinecone to optimize index structures, enhancing the speed and accuracy of information retrieval.

Metadata Addition: Metadata is added to the indexed documents to provide additional context and improve search results.

Alignment Rectification: The project includes a feature to rectify alignment issues that may arise during the indexing and retrieval process.

Context Retrieval: The system retrieves the appropriate context by calculating the similarity between the query and chunks of text within the legal documents. This is achieved using a domain-specific embedding model.

Re-ranking Capability: The project incorporates the re-ranking capability of the Lama model to enhance precision. This ensures that the most relevant and accurate information is retrieved.

## Usage
This project can be utilized by legal professionals and researchers to efficiently retrieve relevant excerpts from a vast database of legal documents. By inputting specific prompts, users can obtain precise information tailored to their needs.

## Future Work
Future enhancements to this project may include refining the domain-specific embedding model and expanding the database of legal documents to cover a broader range of legal topics and jurisdictions.
